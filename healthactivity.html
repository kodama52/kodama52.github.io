            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p> During my three month internship, I was part of a Design team of 11 individuals. I worked closely with three senior designers on the AccuWeather Now video feature and the Health & Activities page for both mobile application and desktop website. </p> 
            
            <P>My internship ended during the A/B testing phase for each of these projects as the designs were finalized. </P>

            <p>The Challenge</p>
            <h2>The Countdown Starts, Now!</h2>
            <p>Upon joining AccuWeather's design team, I had the challenge to learn as much as I could and maximizing my impact within a three-month time-frame. My UX Leader gave me three main tasks;</p>
            <p>1. Craft a comprehensive user experience for the AccuWeather Now video feature seamlessly integrated into the mobile application.</p>
            <p>2. Enhance the user experience of the Health & Activities web page by implementing improved experiences and click rate to the design and functionality.</p>
            <p>3. Develop a set of UX templates and standards to be utilized by the UX team in upcoming projects, promoting consistency and efficiency in the design process. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Navigating the intricacies of each project, which spanned across mobile (iOS & Android) platforms and their desktop/mobile website, presented a formidable challenge. Fast learning and effective time management were indispensable skills that enabled me to have meaningful work.</p>

            <p> Learning the Service </p>
            <h2>Putting on My Reading Glasses</h2>
            <p>After spending several weeks at AccuWeather, my senior designer, who oversees my work, recommended that I embark on a personal project. This suggestion aimed to provide me the opportunity to take full responsibility for a project, incorporating 2-week sprint schedules to facilitate structured progress and ownership.</p>
            <p>I decided to explore the design team's backlog to identify a project that was interesting yet not fully developed. I settled on the <b>Health & Activities Page</b>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This Health & Activities page is seamlessly integrated across both the <b>mobile</b> and <b>desktop</b> platforms of AccuWeather. It showcases a diverse range of activities and health conditions impacted by the prevailing weather conditions.</p>

            <h2>What's Happening Over There?</h2>
            <p>To guarantee that my designs would be both impactful and meaningful, I chose to undertake a series of analyses, ensuring to regularly consult with our team's data analyst for insights and guidance.</p>


            <p>To maintain an empathetic design approach, I documented users' preferences for this new feature by jotting down quotes from their interviews. And I studied the user's path through the website to understand pain points and/or lack of engagement.</p>
			<P>At this stage, I wanted an even closer look at what current users are familiar with. To achieve this, I've initiated a comprehensive market analysis of several competitors to understand how I can increase traffic on the Health & Activities  page. I learned that marketers report a <b>20% sales boost</b> from personalized experiences, now a fundamental expectation for <b>70% of consumers</b>. </P>

            <p>From my research, I decided to create three main changes to the page to encourage positive user interaction. Each of these proposed changes are based off of data points I received from our Data Analyst. </P>
              <p>1. Improvement of the tiles so that variables are displayed clearly and uniformly.</p>
              <p>2. Create a logical flow in the page so there is no scrolling to view hidden elements.</p>

            <p><s>I am groot</s>..After reviewing each of the tiles, I noticed that several variables are measured differently in the initial design. Some use scales ranging from <u>low to extreme</u> (good to bad weather), while others use scales from <u>poor to ideal</u> (conditions). This discrepancy (seen below) does not present itself until we view the graphs, and was confusing for many users, as highlighted by <b>27% of user interviews</b>. </p>

        </section>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>From this observation, I simply flipped the x & y axis from poor - ideal to <u>ideal to poor</u>. This approach aims to streamline the user experience and minimize confusion while maintaining consistency across all measurements.</p>

            </div>  
            </div>
        <p>I then started to create different mock-ups of the tiles, intending to include a small bar graph at the bottom to signify the severity of the intensity at that time. However, ultimately, I decided not to go this route due to accessibility factors.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, this was not a dead end in my design process. The tile designs reminded me of a flashcard application I used in the past, where you could add or remove cards... this got me thinking.</p>

            <h2>Curator</h2>
            <p>I wanted to make proper use of the tiles, by displaying them in a meaningful way. It is a shame to just toss them all over the page to overwhelm our users, so I was thinking how I could make the experience so good that people would want to stay longer than a few seconds <u>and</u> come back.</p>

            <p>As I mentioned earlier, I wanted each graph to have a uniform scale, so I switched the X and Y axes on one to achieve this. However, the more I looked into the user responses, I realized that around <u>18% of users</u> were looking for more simplistic data on their activities. Many of these graphs would display five variables or more. So, I decided to create toggles for each variable, which would generate interactive graphs to tailor to each user's preferences.</p>

            <p>Looking back at my internship with AccuWeather, Designing with the team at AccuWeather was a genuine joy for me. The collaborative atmosphere, coupled with the guidance from the design lead, allowed me to immerse myself in the creative process without the distractions of company politics. I am sincerely grateful to, Bradley, the design lead for shielding me from such concerns and providing an environment that prioritized learning and meaningful design contributions over typical 'intern' projects.</p>
            <p>What stood out most during my internship was the realization that I derived genuine satisfaction from both ends of the design spectrum. Understanding the intricacies of a specific project and comprehending its broader impact on the company became equally gratifying for me. This newfound appreciation for the holistic view of the design process is something I carry forward with me as a valuable insight gained during my time at AccuWeather.</p>
