                <p>Upon joining CATA design team, I had the challenge to understand the current situation with the mobile application. After some brief research I found that the current application suffers from frequent crashes causing unreliable bus information and many hidden features, which has led to a significant 62% decrease in user downloads for the original CATA application. Additionally, it has garnered a dismal customer rating of 1.7 out of 5.0 on the App Store, highlighting the dissatisfaction among users with its performance and usability.</p>
                <p><center>• • •</center></p>
                <p>Following discussions with key stakeholders, it has been identified that the CATA Bus app should focus on the following key features:</p>
                 <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4">
                        <li><strong class="font-medium"></strong>Real-time Bus Tracking: Implement functionality that allows users to track the location of buses in real-time. This will enable users to plan their journeys more effectively by knowing the exact whereabouts of their bus.</li>
                        <li><strong class="font-medium"></strong>Alerts and Notifications: Incorporate a system for delivering alerts and notifications to users regarding delays, cancellations, or changes in bus schedules. This feature will empower users to adjust their travel plans accordingly, minimizing inconvenience and disruptions.</li>

                <p>Venturing out to bus stops, I engaged in meaningful conversations with diverse groups of individuals. Eight generous people graciously shared their time, enabling me to uncover their unique needs and desires. Drawing from these interactions, I swiftly crafted a paper prototype, poised to gather additional feedback from several more cohorts. In total, I conversed with 11 students, 3 faculty members, and 6 visitors.</p>

                <p>Following multiple feedback loops, design iterations, and AB testing, I finalized the designs. I decided to change the application's color from blue to red to match the company's logo color. Based off of the rider's feedback, I added several key features, including, a search bar, bus stop details, and a favorite route menu.</p>

                <p>The search bar was implemented for riders to quickly find the bus route or choose from the recently searched list.

                <p>To address the initial confusion with the application, I've developed a comprehensive pop-up feature tailored specifically for accessing bus stop information. This pop-up closely resembles the traditional bus schedules displayed at each stop, providing riders with a familiar interface. The aim is to assist passengers of all ages in quickly locating and interpreting relevant information without the need for extensive relearning. By streamlining the process, riders can focus on catching their bus with ease, rather than grappling with the intricacies of an app.</p>

            <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-700">
               <p>Navigating through a four-semester-long internship, I encountered a series of challenging situations, particularly as this marked my inaugural venture into the realm of UX design beyond the confines of academia. Having a lot of theoretical knowledge from my studies, I was eager to apply these principles to a live project. However, the transition from theory to practice proved to be more difficult than I had anticipated, presenting me with a many roadblocks and invaluable learning opportunities.</p>
               <p>One of the most significant challenges I faced at the outset was grappling with imposter syndrome, a common phenomenon among newcomers to any field. As I delved into the intricacies of real-world UX design, I couldn't shake the feeling of inadequacy and self-doubt, questioning whether I truly belonged in this professional environment. Overcoming this internal barrier required much effort to acknowledge my achievements and embrace the learning journey ahead, rather than succumbing to feelings of unworthiness.</p>
               <p>Communication issues also emerged as a recurring challenge, particularly within the context of team dynamics. Collaborating with diverse individuals with varying backgrounds and perspectives necessitated effective communication and collaboration. However, miscommunications and misunderstandings occasionally arose, leading to friction and discord within the team. Addressing these communication challenges required patience, empathy, and a willingness to actively listen and engage with my colleagues to foster a more cohesive and productive working environment.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, I grappled with the tendency to rely on assumptions rather than grounding my decisions in empirical data. As a novice UX designer, I often found myself jumping to conclusions or making design choices based on intuition rather than conducting thorough research and analysis. Recognizing the limitations of this approach, I endeavored to create a more data-driven mindset, prioritizing user research and usability testing to inform my design decisions effectively.</p>
               <p>In hindsight, these challenges, though difficult at the time, served as invaluable learning experiences that ultimately shaped me into a more resilient, adaptable, and empathetic designer. By confronting imposter syndrome head-on, fostering open and transparent communication within the team, and prioritizing data-driven decision-making, I emerged from my internship with newfound confidence and a deeper understanding of the complexities of UX design in practice.</p>
