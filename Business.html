								<h2>My Vision</h2>
								<p>Living in State College, PA I always found myself looking for more to do than eat out and shop for clothing. As an avid gamer, I noticed there was a lack of infrastructure, but a huge community of gamers. There are many people interested in gaming as well but either cannot afford to have a proper PC or just have no space living in a dorm. So I decided to open Spawn Room Gaming Center. It would run from mid-afternoon to the very early am hours. The business will supply the gamers with the appropriate equipment to play any game they desire. As well as give a central meeting place for them to gather and socialize.</p>
								<p>You can read about my full business plan, model, and struggles <a href="assets/Spawnroom.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Or if you prefer a brief overview check out the executive summary below.</p>

								<H2>Value Proposition</H2>
								<p>The Spawn Room Gaming Center aims to provide local gamers high-end equipment and space to play casually or competitively with one another.</p>
								
						
								<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
								<p>Spawn Room Gaming Center will be a small business located in State College, PA off of College Avenue. This business will offer high-end gaming equipment to be used as a service for those who do not own gaming computers and those who want to play in a community. A common issue that casual and competitive gamers have is not being able to afford the correct equipment. Since a high-end gaming machine can cost anywhere from $900 to $2000. Most people who start gaming will see this upfront cost of roughly $1000 and purchase a very low-end computer instead, which causes them to have a worse gaming experience. With new gamers purchasing a budget computer for gaming, they are limiting the number of games they can play, and the games they can play will be of very low quality. Another problem with gaming is that people want to be able to share their experiences. For most people, when they game they want to do so with friends since gaming can be an extremely social hobby. Though it is hard to find people with similar gaming interests to share your experiences through online sources. By attending Spawn Room Gaming Center customers will be able to game on high-end computers and mingle with others that share similar interests. This, in turn, will create a strong community that will continue to return in the future.  </p>
								<p>There is currently no direct competition for this type of business in State College. We would be the first to open this category here in State College. Therefore, it is a great opportunity to open and communicate with the target market to see what they would want out of a gaming center. Spawn Room will also need to secure a trademark in the first year of opening for branding purposes. Though, initially, the company will have a trademark pending until further notice due to time restraints. It has been calculated that the initial costs of opening the LAN Center will be roughly $76,000. Though, even with this high entry cost, all upfront equipment costs will be earned back within a three to six-month period.</p>
								<p>Spawn Room Gaming Center is composed of highly motivated young professionals who have diverse educational background and skill sets. Our founding member has been involved in the esports community for close to ten years, so our business understands what our target market wants/thinks they want for a gaming center. We are excited by the opportunity to help bring this business to life in such a great community.</p>

								<h2>Market Research</h2>
 								<p>As previously stated, the potential target market for our LAN center will be directly impacted by different esport events around the world. Each year the value of the market increases by 40% and it is expected to have a market value of 1.65 billion US dollars by the year 2020. With this in mind, the gaming center will be targeting gamers that want to experience a(n) esports/gaming community while using high profile desktop computers as well. Our target market will not be the entire gaming community since it is too vast to target, but it will be the majority of that community in the State College area.</p>

								<h2>Barriers to Entry</h2>
								There are a few barriers to entry in creating a gaming center. The main two are computer/ equipment costs and finding the correct location. Computers are a huge cost since an average gaming setup will cost $1,000 for the desktop, $200 for a gaming monitor, $160 for a gaming mouse & keyboard, $200 for a gaming chair, and $15 for a mouse pad. Take all of these costs and multiply them by 30 and that is the initial cost of computer equipment. The price of 30 computers and peripherals will be roughly $45,000. Though, there is a possibility of buying bulk deals with different computer companies, thus lowering the price to around $28,000. The other big barrier to entry is the insurance of all the equipment. Since there will be around $45,000 worth of equipment in the store at all times insurance of the business will be $4,320 yearly with a $500 deductible. On top of all the equipment & insurance costs, there will have to be a renovation cost of the brick & mortar site of operations. This can range anywhere from 10,000 - 30,000 dollars depending on the condition of the location. The overall barrier to entry is the initial cost of supplies and setting up the store. It will be somewhere around 78,000 to start the business. [3 month turn-around with 50 customers spending $15 per day] ---- [6-8 month turn-around more realistic]</p>
